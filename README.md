(00:00) welcome to isabelle explains in this super short video i will show you how to simplify a fraction this big [Music] so the first thing that you're going to do when you're simplifying any fraction is that you're going to find the greatest common factor between the two numbers right in this case you have two big numbers that's a lot of factors to look for so my advice is start with a smaller number so in this case we're gonna look for the factors of 171.
(00:31) now we know that 171 is an odd number which means that it's not going to have any even factors so we can skip all of those so we start with 1 and 171 then we go to three it would be three and fifty seven we go to five we know that five is not going to be a factor because this does not end in zero or five we go to seven we check on the calculator we see it is not a factor we go to 9 and we see that it is 9 and 19.
(01:01) then we go to 11 and if you saw my other video on tricks with the table of 11 you will see that this is not a multiple of 11 because 1 plus 1 is not 7. then we go to 13 we see that 13 is also not a factor we go to 15 cannot be a factor because this does not end in 5 or 0. we go to 17 is also not a factor and then we go to 19 which is a factor already but we already found out so we don't need to do anything else we're done with that one what we're going to do next is we're going to see which one of these factors is also a
(01:39) factor of the bigger number and we start with the biggest number first so we see that 171 is not a factor of 28 but we see that 57 is so what we're going to do is we're going to divide 57 top and bottom and we get 3 over 4 and bam done that is how you simplify a fraction that big [Music] bye
